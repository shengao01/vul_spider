They have been replaced by the Modicon M580 ePAC controller, Schneider Electric’s most current product. Schneider Electric recommends users migrate to the Modicon M580 ePAC. To mitigate risks associated with this Modbus vulnerability, users should immediately set up network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access to Port 502/TCP. Schneider Electric general security recommendations: Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. Physical controls should be in place so no unauthorized persons have access to the ICS and safety controllers, peripheral equipment, or the ICS and safety networks. All controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in the “Program” mode. All programming software should be kept in locked cabinets and should never be connected to any network other than the network for the intended devices. All methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network (e.g., CDs, USB drives, etc.) should be scanned before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks. Laptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network should never be allowed to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

Contact an Optergy Reseller who has access to this no charge software update. If unsure who to contact, send email to info@optergy.com The latest Optergy software updates include important security updates including enhancements to prevent unwanted intrusion. In addition to these software updates, Optergy emphasizes it is important for users to ensure the site network is also secure to add an extra layer of security. To keep the Optergy system safer from unintended access, Optergy recommends the following: Close Port 22 or disable port forwarding to Optergy server for Port 22 (SSH). This port is only used for technical support to remotely diagnose problems. If Port 22 is needed, open only for the duration of the support activity. Default state should be closed. Use secure SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connections when crossing Internet, this means using an enterprise LAN that has firewalls and routers to block incoming traffic. Alternatively, deploy the Optergy OpenVPN, which is built in and offers encrypted communication. Optergy supports SSL for encrypted communication. Use strong passwords. A strong password has a minimum of 12 characters, includes numbers, symbols, capital letters, lowercase letters, is not a Dictionary word or combination of Dictionary words, and doesn’t rely on obvious substitutions. Never share passwords. Concurrent logins can be prevented in web server and portal preferences. Use expiring passwords. Users of the system come and go, an expiring password will at least keep out people who may be no longer authorized to use the system. Always regularly update your software. Optergy updates always include stability, security, and other enhancements to maximize performance and reduce risk of downtime.

NCCIC recommends those using the SNMP mitigation strategy implement the following best practices: Apply extended access control lists (ACLs) to block unauthorized computers from accessing the device. Access to devices with read and/or write SNMP permission should be strictly controlled. If monitoring and change management are done through separate software, then they should be on separate devices. Segregate SNMP traffic onto a separate management network. Management network traffic should be out-of-band; however, if device management must coincide with standard network activity, all communication occurring over that network should use some encryption capability. If the network device has a dedicated management port, it should be the sole link for services like SNMP, Secure Shell (SSH), etc. For additional SNMP security recommendations see the following US-CERT Alert: https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-156A NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability.

Schneider Electric’s security notice SEVD-2019-045-01 is available at the following location: https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/ SEVD-2019-045-01/ Schneider Electric strongly recommends following industry cybersecurity best practices, such as: Physical controls should be in place so no unauthorized person would have access to the ICS and safety controllers, peripheral equipment, or the ICS and safety networks. All controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in the “Program” mode. All programming software should be kept in locked cabinets and should never be connected to any network other than the network for the devices it is intended. All methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network (e.g., CDs, USB drives, etc.)should be scanned before use in terminals or any node connected to these networks. Laptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network should never be allowed to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation. 4.4 SIEMENS Siemens has investigated the vulnerability report on PLC cycle time influences and concludes the report does not demonstrate a valid vulnerability for Siemens PLCs. 4.5 WAGO WAGO recommends users operate the devices in closed networks or protect them with a firewall against unauthorized access. Another recommended mitigation is to limit network traffic via the switch rate limit feature according to application needs. Please also consult the product manuals on the WAGO website, as this is a known problem for some devices.

Physical controls should be in place so that no unauthorized person would have access to the ICS and safety controllers, peripheral equipment, or the ICS and safety networks. All controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in “Program” mode. All programming software should be kept in locked cabinets and should never be connected to any network other than the network for the devices that it is intended. All methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network, such as CDs, USB drives, etc., should be scanned before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks. Laptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network should never be allowed to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.
